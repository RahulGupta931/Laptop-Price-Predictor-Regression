## Project Overview  
This project implements a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on features such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage, and more. By leveraging data preprocessing and feature engineering, this model offers valuable insights into the pricing of laptops, helping users make informed purchasing decisions.

## Features  
- Predict laptop prices based on key features including brand, processor, RAM, storage, and display size.  
- Data preprocessing, feature scaling, and encoding of categorical variables for improved accuracy.  
- Hyperparameter tuning and model selection using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.  
- Flask-based web application for easy deployment and interaction.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of multiple attributes representing laptops and their prices:  
- **Columns:** Name, Company, Year, Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type.  
- The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, and it has been preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.

## Technologies Used  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pickle  
- **Frameworks:** Flask  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab  

## Modeling  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Handled missing values and performed feature scaling and encoding.  
  - Applied techniques like outlier detection and transformation for improved model performance.  
- **Model Selection:**  
  - Compared and evaluated various machine learning algorithms:  
    - Linear Regression  
    - Random Forest  
    - Gradient Boosting  
  - Used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - RÂ² Score to measure the predictive accuracy of the models.  

## Results  
- Achieved an **RÂ² score of 85%**, indicating strong model accuracy.  
- Identified key factors influencing laptop prices, such as brand, processor, and storage capacity.
